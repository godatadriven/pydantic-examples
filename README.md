# pydantic-examples

[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) is a neat package that's used heavily in some libraries that we like, such as [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Snippet from pydantic's docs:

> Data validation and settings management using python type annotations.
> pydantic enforces type hints at runtime, and provides user friendly errors when data is invalid.
> Define how data should be in pure, canonical python; validate it with pydantic.

There are alternatives, such as [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/). Also used by libraries we like, such as [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/). And one of the committers of attrs explains why they prefer it instead in this nice [blogpost](
